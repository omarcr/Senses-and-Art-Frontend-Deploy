                <h1>Purpose of Senses+Art</h1>
                <p>
                For many of us, attending live performances and exhibitions was a regular part of our cultural and social lives, until the pandemic necessitated our isolation. Covid stopped us, especially older adults, from showing or sharing our public appreciation and support for art and artists of any kind. Instead of connection, we have anxiety. Senses+Art attempts to address the feeling of loss and anxiety with three interrelated goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                Our first goal is to inspire calm. Mindfulness is ‘a state of paying attention without judgment.’ (Jon Kabat-Zinn, Stress Reduction Clinic, UMass Medical School). No experience is necessary to use the Senses + Art site. There are no right or wrong answers. Visitors to the site can focus on subject matter or mood or technique when selecting an image. Focusing with our ‘sense perceptions is the foundation of a mindful practice.’ (Eckhart Tolle) 
                </p>
                <p>
                Our second goal is to highlight the contribution we make to an art form during the process of perceiving it.  As we select an image, our visual memories and the associated feelings, engage the temporal lobe via the ‘what’ path of perception. When we select a piece of music, on the other hand, we engage in mimetic reactions to rhythm and tactile sensations created by musical texture. The focus and movement in time and space are experiences which project to the temporal lobe via what is sometimes referred to as the ‘where or how’ path.  By focusing first on an image and then pairing it with the qualities of a musical experience, visitors to the site are engaging in discerning their perceptions and making creative decisions.  We hope to encourage a mindful awareness of perception as an internal resource. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Our third goal is to build a community with our shared experiences. In the journal, visitors can identify the work of art and the piece of music they have chosen.  Having just seen and listened to those pieces, the next visitor may have greater insight into the varieties of creative experience. Looking at the map of visitors, we can expand our sense of a worldwide community worldwide.

                    <h3>Abstract</h3>
                    <p>In the production of musical tones there is often the perception of effort and movement within an environment. In the development of interrelated tones the boundaries of an environment and an evolving relationship between objects within that environment can be sensed.  The places and activities with which one engages through out one’s lifetime produce spatial imagery. Research suggests that many of the cells which encode for spatial navigation are involved with the production of spatial imagery may also be involved with the experience of music.   Those images are stored in our memory and can be retrieved through neural networks independent of the sensory modality involved with the original experience. (1)

                    <h3>Research: The Neurological Basis of Spatial Navigation</h3>
                    <p>
                    “What we are beginning to see is that different cells are encoding for our location, our direction, our speed, features of our environment and our distance from them, places we know and places we’ve been.  It’s likely all the patterns of firing are interconnected and stored so when we move to a new place, we can retrieve a pattern of activity in our memory and potentially move through the stored locations.” (2)

                <div>
                    <h3>Research: Spatial Imagery Is Formed Independently Of Any One Sense Modality </h3>
                    <p>
                    “Spatial working memory maintains representations from vision, hearing, and touch, known as spatial images. Research leads us to hypothesize that spatial images are a-modal. Once spatial images are in the memory, its processing by subsequent mental operations, such as those involved in spatial updating, does not depend on any of the modality-specific features of the input modality.” (3)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    From sound alone.. “We can perceive the size of an object dropped into water, that something is rolling, the material composition of an object from the sound of an impact, and the force of an impact. We can distinguish objects with different shapes, and we can tell the length of a rod dropped onto the floor. When something is dropped, we can hear whether it bounced or broke. We are good at recognizing natural sounds, such as footsteps, hands clapping, paper tearing, and so on. We can tell that a cup is being filled and when it is full.” (4)

                    <p>
                    Because the pattern of frequency components that comprise the vibration of an object and the way that pattern changes over time is determined by the nature of the object and the events that caused it to vibrate, that pattern and the way it changes provide a great deal of information about the object and the interaction that produced the vibration.
